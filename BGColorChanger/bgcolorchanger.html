<!-- Notes

Math.random(): Generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Math.random() * 16777215: Multiplies the random number by 16777215. The number 16777215 is often used because it's the
decimal representation of the hexadecimal color FFFFFF, which is white. So, this step effectively generates a random
number in the range of 0 to FFFFFF.

Math.floor(...): Rounds down the result to the nearest whole number. This ensures that the value is an integer.

.toString(16): Converts the integer to a hexadecimal string. The 16 passed as an argument specifies that the conversion
should be in base-16 (hexadecimal). This step is crucial because it ensures that the generated number is represented in
the hexadecimal format.

'#' + ...: Prepends the '#' symbol to the hexadecimal string. This is how hexadecimal color codes are commonly
represented in CSS and web development.


.toString() Method:

In JavaScript, the .toString() method is used to convert a value to a string.
If you call .toString() without any arguments, it converts a number to a string in base-10 (decimal) format.
.toString(16):

The toString() method can take an argument, which specifies the base to use for representing the number.
In this case, the argument is 16, indicating that the conversion should be in base-16, which is hexadecimal.
Hexadecimal (Base-16):

Hexadecimal is a numeral system with a base of 16.
It uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent values. For example, 10 in decimal is represented as A in hexadecimal, 15 is represented as F, and 16 is represented as 10.
Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16.
Example:

Let's say x = 255 (which is FF in hexadecimal).
x.toString(16) would convert 255 to the string 'FF'.


Base 10 (Decimal):

Base 10, also known as the decimal system, is the standard numbering system used by humans.
It uses 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Each digit's value is a power of 10 based on its position in the number. For example, in the number 543, the digit 3 represents 
3
×
1
0
0
3×10 
0
 , the digit 4 represents 
4
×
1
0
1
4×10 
1
 , and the digit 5 represents 
5
×
1
0
2
5×10 
2
 .
Most everyday calculations and numerical representations are in base 10.
Base 16 (Hexadecimal):

Base 16, also known as the hexadecimal system, is a numeral system that uses 16 digits.
It uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent values. In hexadecimal, A represents 10, B represents 11, C represents 12, D represents 13, E represents 14, and F represents 15.
Each digit's value is a power of 16 based on its position in the number. For example, in the hexadecimal number 1A3, the digit 3 represents 
3
×
1
6
0
3×16 
0
 , the digit A represents 
10
×
1
6
1
10×16 
1
 , and the digit 1 represents 
1
×
1
6
2
1×16 
2
 .
Hexadecimal is commonly used in computing, particularly for representing colors, memory addresses, and binary data.
